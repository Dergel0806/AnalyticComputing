### Retail_Data_Analytics

Let's investigate [dataset of sales](https://www.kaggle.com/manjeetsingh/retaildataset) to get understanding of factors that can predict sales of shops. We'll try to answer questions like if temperature alone can predict sale, check same for fuel price and some other variables. For this we'll build several simple linear regression models and try to predict one row from the dataset, which we would not include in the training dataset. Before doing this we'll investigate data to have initial understanding of what we shoul include in a model.  
  
Next, we'll try to build multiple regression model and figure out, whether some of the variables together can predict sales better.   
  
After doing this we'll check assumptions (which should be done before modeling, but since we have a goal of doing research about linear regression, we can do this after). Those assumptions will give us understanding of whether this data is a good fit for linear regression.
