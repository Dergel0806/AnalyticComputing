### USA_crimes_analysis

We want to conduct research on [crimes dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/marshallproject/crime-rates) and analyze data to find answers to questions about crime in different regions across the years.  
Research will be focused on comparing different agencies and states in terms of crime percapita and violent crimes. Other types of crimes will also be investigated.  
  
We'll investigate each type of crime separately and answer next questions. Those question will be researched from historical point of view, so, research will be conducted on both modern and historical data. 
What are the biggest and smallest values for each type of the crime in dataset, such as violent crimes, homicides, rapes, assaults and robberies?   
  
What are the safest states to live in and how much worse the situation is in the most dangerous states? Which states are the most dangerous and so, should have more attention from law enforcement?  
Which cities have most crimes per capita and what is other available data about them?
